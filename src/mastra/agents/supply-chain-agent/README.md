# Global Supply Chain Risk Analysis Agent

## Overview

The Global Supply Chain Risk Analysis Agent is an advanced AI system designed to continuously monitor and predict supply chain disruptions by analyzing multiple data sources including shipping data, weather conditions, news feeds, and port operations. This agent leverages the power of Mastra framework and can be deployed on Nosana's GPU infrastructure for heavy computational tasks.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Real-time Shipping Monitoring**: Tracks vessel movements, delays, and cargo information across major trade routes
- **Weather Risk Analysis**: Analyzes weather patterns that could impact shipping routes and port operations
- **News Intelligence**: Processes news feeds to identify geopolitical events, strikes, and policy changes affecting supply chains
- **Port Status Monitoring**: Monitors congestion levels and operational status of critical global ports
- **Multi-factor Risk Assessment**: Correlates data from multiple sources to provide comprehensive risk analysis

### AI-Powered Features
- **Early Warning System**: Predicts disruptions before they become critical
- **Risk Correlation**: Uses machine learning to identify patterns across disparate data sources
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates actionable intelligence reports with confidence scores
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runs automated workflows for 24/7 supply chain surveillance

## Technical Architecture

### Tools Available
1. **shippingDataTool**: Fetches real-time vessel positions and delay information
2. **weatherRiskTool**: Analyzes weather conditions affecting shipping routes
3. **newsAnalysisTool**: Processes news feeds for supply chain relevant events
4. **portStatusTool**: Monitors port congestion and operational status
5. **riskAssessmentTool**: Performs comprehensive multi-factor risk analysis

### Workflow Integration
The agent includes an automated monitoring workflow that:
- Continuously analyzes shipping conditions
- Assesses weather-related risks
- Monitors news for disruptions
- Checks port operational status
- Generates comprehensive risk reports

## Usage Examples

### Basic Risk Assessment
```typescript
// Get shipping data for Pacific region
const shippingData = await agent.useTool('shippingDataTool', {
  region: 'Pacific',
  vessel_type: 'container'
});

// Analyze weather risks for key ports
const weatherRisks = await agent.useTool('weatherRiskTool', {
  locations: ['Shanghai', 'Los Angeles', 'Singapore'],
  forecast_days: 7
});
```

### Comprehensive Analysis
```typescript
// Perform full risk assessment for electronics supply chain
const riskAssessment = await agent.useTool('riskAssessmentTool', {
  supply_chain_segment: 'electronics',
  geographic_focus: ['Asia-Pacific', 'North America'],
  time_horizon: '30d'
});
```

### News Monitoring
```typescript
// Monitor news for supply chain disruptions
const newsAnalysis = await agent.useTool('newsAnalysisTool', {
  keywords: ['strike', 'port closure', 'trade war', 'sanctions'],
  time_range: '24h',
  regions: ['Asia', 'Europe', 'North America']
});
```

## Risk Levels

The agent uses a standardized risk classification system:

- **LOW**: Normal operations, minimal disruption risk
- **MEDIUM**: Some delays possible, monitor conditions
- **HIGH**: Significant disruptions likely, implement contingencies
- **CRITICAL**: Severe disruptions imminent, immediate action required

## Real-World Applications

### For Logistics Companies
- Optimize routing based on real-time risk assessments
- Proactive customer communication about potential delays
- Dynamic inventory management based on supply chain risks

### For Manufacturing
- Supplier diversification recommendations
