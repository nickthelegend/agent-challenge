# Global Supply Chain Risk Analysis Agent

## Project Summary

This project implements a sophisticated AI agent for global supply chain risk analysis, built using the Mastra framework for the Nosana Builders Challenge. The agent demonstrates real-world utility by providing early warning systems for supply chain disruptions.

## Innovation Highlights

### 1. Multi-Modal AI Reasoning
- **Data Fusion**: Combines structured data (shipping schedules, port data) with unstructured data (news articles, weather reports)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies correlations between seemingly unrelated events (e.g., weather patterns and labor disputes)
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses historical patterns to forecast potential disruptions

### 2. Real-Time Intelligence
- **Continuous Monitoring**: 24/7 surveillance of global supply chain conditions
- **Early Warning System**: Alerts before disruptions become critical
- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Risk levels adjust in real-time based on changing conditions

### 3. Comprehensive Data Sources
- **Shipping Data**: Vessel tracking, delays, cargo information
- **Weather Intelligence**: Meteorological conditions affecting trade routes
- **News Analysis**: Geopolitical events, strikes, policy changes
- **Port Operations**: Congestion levels, operational status
- **Risk Correlation**: Multi-factor analysis for comprehensive assessment
